### 📌 Description

This repository offers a powerful and flexible inventory optimization tool built around a Random Forest-based forecasting model. By analyzing historical sales or demand data, it enables businesses to predict future trends and optimize stock levels accordingly. Whether you're managing retail shelves, e-commerce inventory, or warehouse supplies, this tool provides data-driven insights to reduce stockouts and overstocking, ultimately improving operational efficiency and cost management.

### 🔍 Overview

At the heart of this project is a Streamlit-powered interactive dashboard that makes time series forecasting accessible even to non-technical users. From uploading data to generating multi-period forecasts, every step is streamlined with built-in automation and visualization tools. Users can select a target variable, process temporal features, train a predictive model, evaluate its performance, and export results—all within a single interface.

This solution is ideal for small to mid-sized businesses looking to introduce data-driven planning into their inventory or supply chain workflow without the need for complex infrastructure or external services.
